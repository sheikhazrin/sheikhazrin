  | I am going to share with you how to become a veteran developer like me.!{' '} 
  | I started programming using language like !{' '} 
  b C, Visual Basic, ASP, PHP, OOP with SQL, MySQL database.
  | Well, it does not just end there
  | .

p
  | Technology change so fast. New programming languages, frameworks !{' '}
  b (Laravel, NodeJS, React, Vue, NextJS NuxtJS, TypesScript) and libraries pop up all the time. !{' '}
  | I am repeating myself to keep learning, increase skills, !{' '}
  | and grow superb by solving problems through technology !{' '}
  |.

q So a programmer building software twenty years ago was solving the same problems (more or less) as an engineer today. 

p
  | It doesnâ€™t matter if you are an experienced or newbie programmer. 
  q Learning by doing brings much more results than learning passively, especially when it comes to programming. !{' '}
